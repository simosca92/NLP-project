*speech recognizer of a set of commands trained from scratch using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). This model is implemented in a library that we used off-the-shelf, CMUSphinx (open source speech recognition toolkit). Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a simple and effective framework for modelling time-varying spectral vector sequences.
